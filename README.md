Work in progress....

This code takes the C portion of Whaleygeek's pyenergenie project and builds a standalone C library, removing the python scripts.

The next step is to create a very simple C program (or collection of programs) that utilise the C library to allow communication with Energenie radio controlled sockets in the MiHome range.
